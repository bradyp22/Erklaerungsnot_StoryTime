The old hund was driving his porsche along the Hauptstrasse when he spotted a Biergarten near the walk.
He started to salivate when he saw that it served Doener.
So the hund pulled over, and the scents overtook him; Doener, Bratwurst, Apfelkuchen. "I must have them all!", he thought.
The old hund was enthralled with his Bratwurst with a bun fresh from a Baeckerei.
Finishing up, he wanted to walk into the Ratskeller to learn about making Bier illegally.
It is always nice to wear my lederhose in the winter.
The Klimaanlage also has to be set to super hot or else I get chilly.
My mom and I always loved to listen to the Rammstein in concert.
The best part of the concerts were the Bratwursts and a stein.
